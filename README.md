The imaging Locomotor Activity Monitor (iLAM) is a tool to record and quantify activity patterns of experimental organism. This was originally described in Dayton & Owens (2024): [iLAM: Imaging Locomotor Activity Monitor for circadian phenotyping of large-bodied flying insects](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14403).
