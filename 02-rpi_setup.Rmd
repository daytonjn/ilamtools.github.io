# Raspberry Pi Zero w/Camera Setup

Steps to program the Raspberry Pi Zero computers to capture and store images:

**1. Obtain necessary cables/connectors:**

-   USB 2.0 to microSD card reader (to image SD card on a PC)
-   USB 2.0 microUSB male to USB female adapter (to connect keyboard with Pi)
-   Keyboard with USB 2.0 wire
-   Micro HDMI male to HDMI female adapter & HDMI cable (to connect monitor with Pi) or micro HDMI to HDMI cable

**2. Install operating system:**

```{r aa, fig.cap='Raspberry Pi Imager', echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/raspberry_pi_imager.png")
```

-   Use microSD card reader to mount SD card onto a PC
-   Download and open [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
    -   Choose OS → Raspberry Pi OS (Other) → Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)
    -   Choose Storage → *Drive referring to microSD card*
    -   *Optional*: Gears →
        -   Set hostname (*name of the pi on your wifi network that you ssh [pi_name]\@[IP Address] into*)
        -   Enable ssh
        -   Set username and password (*user login information to access the pi*)
        -   Set locale settings (*e.g., America/New York & us*)
    -   Write
-   Disconnect and insert formatted microSD card into Pi
-   Connect Pi to keyboard, monitor, and power source
-   Once connected to power, Pi automatically turns on

**2. Login with default or already specified login information:**

-   raspberrypi login: pi
-   password: raspberry

**3. Configure Pi settings:** `sudo raspi-config`

-   Use arrow keys and Enter to navigate
-   1 → S1 Connect to wifi
    -   SSID: wifi network name
    -   Passphrase: wifi password
-   1 → S3 change pi password
-   1 → S4 change pi name (not login)
-   3 → I1 enable camera attachment
-   3 → I2 enable remote access (`ssh`)
-   5 → L2 set timezone
-   Finish (type `y` when asked if you want to reboot)

**4. Add static IP address for remote access:** <https://raspberrypi-guide.github.io/networking/set-up-static-ip-address>

**5. Continue programming directly or remotely access the Pi through terminal from another PC:**

```         
ssh login_name@[IP address]
password:
```

**6. Make a folder/directory named 'still' to hold images:** `mkdir still_[xxx]`

-   *Note: [xxx] refers to the login name of the Raspberry Pi associated with the iLAM*

**7. Make a directory named script to hold scripts:** `mkdir script_[xxx]`

**8. Write a script using a text-editor (e.g., nano) named still\_[xxx].sh:** `sudo nano ./script_[xxx]/still_[xxx].sh` and write the following text:

```         
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +"%m%d.%H%M")
sudo raspistill -o /home/$USER/still_$USER/$USER.$DATE.jpg
```

-   This script will take images and save them along w/ metadata into the still\_\$USER directory:
    -   (Line 1) necessary for any bash file with instructions
    -   (Line 2) sets the format for the date and time in the file name
    -   (Line 3) command for pi to take a photo and store it with specified file name/location.
-   Hit `control^X` to exit (type `y` when asked if you want to save)

**9. To automatically upload/copy images into a remote directory, you may (A) use scp to upload each image after it's taken, or (b) mount a remote directory and then copy each image.**

-   `ssh-keygen` and `ENTER` to generate a new SSH key to enable a custom script to automatically upload images without requiring a password input

-   `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa [remote_PC_hostname]@[remote_PC IP address]`

-   Input password for remote_PC

-   Option A: Add the following line to the end of still\_[xxx].sh:

``` bash
scp /home/$USER/still_$USER/$USER.$DATE.jpg [remote_PC_hostname]@[remote_PC IP address]:[directory that you want images saved into]/
```

-   Option B: Add the following lines to the end of still\_[xxx].sh:

``` bash
sleep 10
scp /home/$USER/still_$USER/$USER.$DATE.jpg /home/$USER/mount_$USER/
```

**10. Schedule the imaging script to run periodically with crontab:**

-   Access the crontab file

```         
sudo crontab -e
```

-   Select the first option to edit the crontab in nano
-   Copy the following to the bottom of the file:

``` bash
*/2 *  *   *   * sh /home/$USER/script_$USER/still_$USER.sh 2>&1
```

-   This tells the pi to execute the still.sh file every 2 minutes (the order is minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week). When setting up a new crontab, always run it past [*crontab.guru*](https://crontab.guru/)!

-   `control^X` to exit (type y when asked if you want to save)

**11. Access Raspberry Pi image files on your PC:**

-   Even if your iLAM/Pi is programmed to upload files to a remote computer over Wifi, at the end of every experiment, we recommend verifying that all images were properly uploaded/transferred. To remotely download images, you may:

-   Option A: Download images via Command line

    -   Log in to the Linux/Powershell on your laptop

        ``` bash
        scp pi@[IP address]:~/still_[xxx]/*.jpg ~/[target directory]`
        ```

-   Option B: Download images via a free file transfer program (FTP) like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

    -   Open FileZilla: In *Site Manager*, choose *New site*

    -   Protocol: SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol

    -   Host: [IP Address of Raspberry Pi]

    -   Logon Type: *Normal*

    -   User: [Pi login name]

    -   Password: [Pi login password]

    -   Connect

**Trouble-shooting**

-raspistill will not take a picture and returns\*\* `*failed to open vchiq instance`:

1.  Verify that the camera is connected and the ribbon cable is not damaged:

    ``` bash
    vcgencmd get_camera
    ```

2.  Determine if the camera or the still\_[xxx].sh script is the issue:

    ``` bash
    raspistill -o /home/$USER/test.jpg
    ```

3.  Modify permissions of the camera: `sudo chmod777 /dev/vchiq`

A Linux reader is required to read the Raspian imaged SD card, when plugged into a Windows PC. [Linux Reader](https://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/) is a free option. Instructions can be found [here](https://raspberrytips.com/read-raspberry-pi-sd-card-windows/).

**Tips:**

-   Useful Linux commands:

    -   \* wildcard (e.g. `*.jpg` == all jpeg files)
    -   `control^A` bring cursor to beginning of line
    -   `control^E` bring cursor to end of line
    -   `control^C` kill process
    -   `clear` clear all previous text from terminal
    -   `ls` list all contents in current folder
    -   `cd directory_path` change to named folder
    -   `cd ~` go to home directory
    -   `cd ..` go up one folder level
    -   `cd -` go back to last folder
    -   `mkdir dir_name` create EMPTY folder (directory)
    -   `rmdir dir_name` remove EMPTY folder
    -   `rm file_name` remove a file
    -   `rm -f file_name` remove a file without asking for permission
    -   `rm -r dir_name` recursively remove all files from folder
    -   `rm -rf dir_name` forcefully remove all files from folder
    -   `ren name_1 name_2` rename something to something else
    -   `cp file_1 file_2` copy file_1 to file_2, creates duplicate. *note*: if file_2 exists will overwrite (NO warning)
    -   `cp -r dir_1 dir_2` copy folder and its contents
    -   `nano file_name` make named file and open text editor
    -   `sudo reboot      reboot pi`
    -   `sudo shutdown now` safely shutdown pi (reboots when plugged in again)
