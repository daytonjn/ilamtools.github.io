# Flight Cage Construction
  The paired iLAM flight cages described in our original publication used the following materials:
  
```{r y, fig.cap='iLAM Materials', echo=FALSE, results=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(readr)

materials_ilam <- read_csv("data/materials_ilam.csv", 
    col_types = cols(`Units/Setup` = col_character()))

knitr::kable(materials_ilam, error=FALSE, caption = "iLAM materials")

```
*All materials were purchased from local hardware stores, art supply chains, Raspberry Pi suppliers, and Amazon*

  The three cage levels were made with the following cuts:

- Top: 31 1/2" x 10 1/2"
    - Two Circles: 13 3/8" diameter (<14" hoop)
- Bottom: 31 1/2" x 10 1/2"
    - Two Circles: 7 1/2" diameter (<8" hoop)
    - Hole for camera ribbon
- Base: 31 1/2" x 10 1/2"

```{r z, fig.cap='iLAM flight cage: front view', echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ilam_in_triangle.jpg")
```


```{r a, fig.cap='iLAM flight cage: top-down view', echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ilam_interior.jpg")
```

  **Tips:**
  
- Cups with moist sponges and a falcon tube with a cotton roll and water (held by velcro) increased the lifespan of experimental insects
- Duct-tape around the camera ribbon cable hole and camera prevented escape by small experimental insects (e.g., *Photinus* species)
- Depending on the insect's color under IR (i.e., white vs. black appearance), change the background of the lid (i.e., white vs. black) to maximize contrast
