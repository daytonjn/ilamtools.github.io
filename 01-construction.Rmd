# Flight Cage Construction

The paired iLAM flight cages described in our original publication used the following materials:

```{r y, fig.cap='iLAM Materials', echo=FALSE, quiet=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(readr)

materials_ilam <- read_csv("data/materials_ilam.csv", 
    col_types = cols(`Units/Setup` = col_character()))

knitr::kable(materials_ilam, error=FALSE, caption = "iLAM materials")

```

*All materials were purchased from local hardware stores, art supply chains, Raspberry Pi suppliers, and Amazon*

The three cage levels were made with the following cuts:

-   Top: 31 1/2" x 10 1/2"
    -   Two Circles: 13 3/8" diameter (\<14" hoop)
-   Bottom: 31 1/2" x 10 1/2"
    -   Two Circles: 7 1/2" diameter (\<8" hoop)
    -   Hole for camera ribbon
-   Base: 31 1/2" x 10 1/2"

```{r z, fig.cap='iLAM flight cage: front view', echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ilam_in_triangle.jpg")
```

```{r a, fig.cap='iLAM flight cage: top-down view', echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ilam_interior.jpg")
```

**Tips:**

-   To increase the lifespan of experimental insects and the experiment's recording duration, add cups with moist sponges and a falcon tube with a cotton roll and water (held by Velcro)
-   To prevent escape by small experimental insects (e.g., *Photinus* species), add duct-tape around the camera ribbon cable hole and camera
-   Depending on the color that the study insect appears under infrared light (i.e., white vs. black appearance), change the background of the lid to maximize contrast
-   To minimize differences in the photographed light environment throughout light:dark/dark:light transitions, we now:
    -   Cover the Raspberry Pi's light sensors with black duct tape or plastic; this "tricks" the Pi to keep it's infrared lights on 24/7
    -   Cover the Raspberry Pi's camera lens with a [longpass filter](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/780nm-127mm-dia-colored-glass-replacement-longpass-filter/43186/) that only permits infrared light to the camera
    -   Optional add-ons: Realtime clock (RTC) module
