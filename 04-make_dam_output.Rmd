# Make DAM Output

Steps to convert iLAM output into Trikinetics DAM format for locomotor activity analyses

1.  Read in iLAM output from image_analysis and parse into a dataframe containing the size, centroid location, and origin (time, pi) of all identified blobs (by_change) with `parse_movements()`

```         
out_file_name = "Pgreeni"
start_photophase = 5 #project-specific, time that lights turn on
end_photophase = 21 #project-specific, time that dark starts

#parse movements into workable dfs: all movements (by_change) and
by_change_Pg <- parse_movements(file_mvmnts = paste0(out_file_name,".csv"),
                             start_photophase = start_photophase,
                             end_photophase = end_photophase)
```

```{r q, fig.cap='iLAM by_change output', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, quiet=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(readr)

example_by_change <- read_csv("data/example_by_change_Pg.csv")[1:5,]

knitr::kable(example_by_change, error=FALSE, caption = "iLAM by_change data frame")

```

2.  Collapse all identified blobs (within by_change\_[]) into a dataframe containing the sum of blobs and number of blobs/movements observed per frame/timepoint (by_frame\_[])

```         
by_frame_Pg <- 
  by_change_Pg %>% ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(pi, ID, time, treatment) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(n = length(s[!is.na(s)]), #number of blobs of size (s) != NA
            s = sum(s, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #sum of blob sizes, NA removed
  dplyr::mutate(n = ifelse(s == 0, 0, n)) %>% #if sum of blobs=0, then n<-0 (otherwise it'd be 1)
  distinct(pi, ID, time, treatment, n, s) #sanity check to remove any duplicates
```

3.  Filter movements captured from rare, noisy images.

-   Noisy values were initially assigned an arbitrary value (2,000,000) by `find_movements()`. This step changes 2,000,000 with NA and then replaces with average value of the preceding and succeeding time points. These rare cases typically only occur at the image following a light-dark transition.
    -   For example, across a 7-day experiment (5040 images), only 0.4% image comparisons were assigned an arbitrary value.

``` R
library(zoo)

by_frame_Pg <-
  by_frame_Pg %>% ungroup() %>%
   mutate(s = replace(s, s==2000000, NA),
          n = replace(n, is.na(s), NA))

by_frame_Pg <-
  by_frame_Pg %>% group_by(pi) %>%
  mutate(s = round((na.locf0(s, fromLast = TRUE) + na.locf0(s, fromLast = FALSE))/2,0),
         n = round((na.locf0(n, fromLast = TRUE) + na.locf0(n, fromLast = FALSE))/2,0)) %>% ungroup()

by_frame_Pg <-
  by_frame_Pg %>% ungroup() %>%
   mutate(s = replace(s, is.na(s), 0),
          n = replace(n, is.na(n), 0))

dplyr::filter(by_frame_Pg, n>0) %>% group_by(pi) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(blob_size = mean((s/n), na.rm=TRUE)) #output the average blob size
  
```

```{r o, fig.cap='iLAM by_frame output', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(readr)

example_by_frame <- read_csv("data/example_by_frame_Pg.csv")[1:5,]

knitr::kable(example_by_frame, error=FALSE, caption = "iLAM by_frame data frame")

```

4.  Use iLAM wrapper `make_dam_file()` to convert by_frame\_[] into a DAM-like output and save as a DAM file with summed blob sizes/total movement (in pixels) per timepoint

```         
ilam_Pg = make_dam_file(by_frame_Pg, variable_name = "s") 

#output a tab-delimited file containing 
write_tsv(ilam_Pg, "ilam_Pg.tsv", col_names = F)
write_tsv(ilam_Pg, "Monitor42.txt", col_names = F) #some analysis programs require Monitor##.txt name
```

```{r n, fig.cap='DAM output for sum of blob sizes', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

example_DAM_s <- read_delim("data/iLAM_Pg_s.tsv", 
    delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, 
    col_names = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)[1:5,]

knitr::kable(example_DAM_s, error=FALSE, caption = "iLAM by_frame converted to DAM format")

```

5.  Use iLAM wrapper `make_dam_file()` to convert by_frame\_[] into a DAM-like output and save as a DAM file with the number of blobs/movements per timepoint

```         
#parse movements into workable dfs: all movements (by_change) and
by_change_Pg <- parse_movements(file_mvmnts = paste0(out_file_name,".csv"),
                                start_photophase = start_photophase,
                                end_photophase = end_photophase)

by_frame_Pg = filter_nblobs(by_change_Pg) #filter out small nblobs using iLAM wrapper filter_nblobs()
ilam_Pg = make_dam_file(by_frame_Pg, variable_name = "n")

write_tsv(ilam_Pg, "ilam_Pg_n.tsv", col_names = F)
write_tsv(ilam_Pg, "Monitor43.txt", col_names = F) #some analysis programs require Monitor##.txt name
```

```{r p, fig.cap='DAM output for number of blobs', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

example_DAM_n <- read_delim("data/iLAM_Pg_n.tsv", 
    delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, 
    col_names = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)[1:5,]

knitr::kable(example_DAM_n, error=FALSE, caption = "iLAM by_frame converted to DAM format")

```
